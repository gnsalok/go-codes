		Why you can't call notify method on type int? Bcz you can’t always take the address of a value in Go?
		- First, you can’t guarantee that every value is addressable. If you can’t take a value’s address,
		  it can’t be shared and therefore a pointer receiver method can’t be used.
		- This next example shows how you can’t always take the address of a value in Go.
