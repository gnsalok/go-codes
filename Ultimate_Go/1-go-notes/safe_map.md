In Go, there is no built-in `SafeMap` type, but when people refer to a "SafeMap" (or thread-safe map), they typically mean a map that is protected from concurrent access issues, as Go's default `map` type is **not safe** for concurrent use. Without protection, if multiple goroutines read and write to a map simultaneously, it can cause a runtime panic or unpredictable behavior.

To address this, a `SafeMap` (or thread-safe map) can be implemented by using synchronization primitives such as `sync.Mutex` or `sync.RWMutex`, or by using Goâ€™s `sync.Map` from the standard library.

### Approaches to Implement a SafeMap in Go

#### 1. Using `sync.Mutex` for Exclusive Locking
This approach uses a `sync.Mutex` to lock the map when reading or writing, ensuring that only one goroutine can access the map at a time.

##### Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

// SafeMap wraps a Go map with a Mutex to ensure safe concurrent access.
type SafeMap struct {
	mu sync.Mutex
	m  map[string]interface{}
}

// NewSafeMap initializes a new SafeMap
func NewSafeMap() *SafeMap {
	return &SafeMap{
		m: make(map[string]interface{}),
	}
}

// Set sets a key-value pair in the map with locking
func (sm *SafeMap) Set(key string, value interface{}) {
	sm.mu.Lock()
	defer sm.mu.Unlock()
	sm.m[key] = value
}

// Get retrieves a value from the map by key with locking
func (sm *SafeMap) Get(key string) (interface{}, bool) {
	sm.mu.Lock()
	defer sm.mu.Unlock()
	val, ok := sm.m[key]
	return val, ok
}

// Delete removes a key-value pair from the map with locking
func (sm *SafeMap) Delete(key string) {
	sm.mu.Lock()
	defer sm.mu.Unlock()
	delete(sm.m, key)
}

func main() {
	safeMap := NewSafeMap()

	// Set key-value pairs
	safeMap.Set("foo", "bar")
	safeMap.Set("hello", "world")

	// Get and print key-value pairs
	if value, ok := safeMap.Get("foo"); ok {
		fmt.Println("foo:", value)
	}

	// Delete a key-value pair
	safeMap.Delete("hello")

	// Attempt to get deleted key
	if _, ok := safeMap.Get("hello"); !ok {
		fmt.Println("Key 'hello' not found")
	}
}
```

#### 2. Using `sync.RWMutex` for Optimized Read/Write Locking
This approach uses a `sync.RWMutex`, which allows multiple goroutines to read from the map concurrently (read lock), but requires exclusive access for writes (write lock).

##### Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

// SafeMap with RWMutex for concurrent safe access.
type SafeMap struct {
	mu sync.RWMutex
	m  map[string]interface{}
}

// NewSafeMap initializes a new SafeMap
func NewSafeMap() *SafeMap {
	return &SafeMap{
		m: make(map[string]interface{}),
	}
}

// Set sets a key-value pair in the map (write lock)
func (sm *SafeMap) Set(key string, value interface{}) {
	sm.mu.Lock()
	defer sm.mu.Unlock()
	sm.m[key] = value
}

// Get retrieves a value from the map (read lock)
func (sm *SafeMap) Get(key string) (interface{}, bool) {
	sm.mu.RLock()
	defer sm.mu.RUnlock()
	val, ok := sm.m[key]
	return val, ok
}

// Delete removes a key-value pair from the map (write lock)
func (sm *SafeMap) Delete(key string) {
	sm.mu.Lock()
	defer sm.mu.Unlock()
	delete(sm.m, key)
}

func main() {
	safeMap := NewSafeMap()

	// Set key-value pairs
	safeMap.Set("foo", "bar")
	safeMap.Set("hello", "world")

	// Concurrently read key-value pairs
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(2)

	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		if value, ok := safeMap.Get("foo"); ok {
			fmt.Println("foo:", value)
		}
	}()

	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		if value, ok := safeMap.Get("hello"); ok {
			fmt.Println("hello:", value)
		}
	}()

	wg.Wait()

	// Delete a key-value pair
	safeMap.Delete("hello")
}
```

#### 3. Using `sync.Map` from the Standard Library
Go also provides `sync.Map`, which is a specialized concurrent map implementation optimized for cases where:
- The map is infrequently updated.
- The map is frequently read by many goroutines.

Unlike the previous examples, `sync.Map` uses specialized techniques internally, such as amortized locks and copy-on-write strategies, to make reads and writes safe and fast.

##### Example with `sync.Map`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	// Create a sync.Map
	var sm sync.Map

	// Store key-value pairs
	sm.Store("foo", "bar")
	sm.Store("hello", "world")

	// Load and print values
	if value, ok := sm.Load("foo"); ok {
		fmt.Println("foo:", value)
	}

	// Delete a key
	sm.Delete("hello")

	// Load a deleted key
	if _, ok := sm.Load("hello"); !ok {
		fmt.Println("Key 'hello' not found")
	}
}
```

### Differences Between Approaches

- **Custom Mutex (`sync.Mutex` / `sync.RWMutex`)**:
  - Provides full control over when locks are acquired and released.
  - `sync.Mutex` locks for both reads and writes, which may not be as efficient in read-heavy workloads.
  - `sync.RWMutex` allows multiple goroutines to read concurrently while blocking writers.
  - Useful when you want fine-grained control over how data is accessed.

- **`sync.Map`**:
  - Convenient and ready to use without needing to implement your own locking.
  - Less control over locking behavior, but internally optimized for cases with more reads than writes.
  - Useful for highly concurrent use cases with fewer updates.

### Conclusion
A `SafeMap` in Go is a map that is protected from concurrent access issues by using synchronization mechanisms like `sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`, or the standard library's `sync.Map`. Depending on the level of control and optimization you need, you can choose to implement your own safe map or use `sync.Map`.
