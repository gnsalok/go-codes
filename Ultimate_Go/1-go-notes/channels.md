## Channels 

- Channels is how you deal with orchestration in Go. [Read more about channels](https://github.com/gnsalok/gotraining/blob/master/topics/go/concurrency/channels/README.md)

- Channels allow goroutines to communicate with each other through the use of `signaling semantics`. 
- Channels accomplish this signaling through the use of sending/receiving data or by identifying state changes on individual channels. 
- Don't architect software with the idea of channels being a queue, focus on signaling and the semantics that simplify the orchestration required.
